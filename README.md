# Chefs-Choice-Front
Welcome to chef's choice!

This is the app for you.. yes You!
Even though you might not have realized it.

Ever encountered that piece of ham that just,
passed the expiry date.. yea me too.
Wouldn't it be great if we had a simple App, 
(subtle hint, this is that app ;) ) to look 
for a recipe based on the ingredients we enter? 
I know.. i know. how has no one thought of ths before?
i asked myself the same question. Well now someone has. 
ME! :D isnt that crazy?? 10 weeks ago i was learning how, 
to console.log("doesn't that seem like a long time ago?")
Now im here building full stack apps. And actually being able
to transfer my ideas into code:D!! i know crazy stuff.. 

enough about me. lets shed some light on the app.. 

# HomePage

why not save it for later? simply add it to your favorites

# Discover

showing exactly what you need to know. what can i use of the igredients
ive entered and what do i still need to get..

# Favorites

you find and save.. end up here.. Lets find out more!
