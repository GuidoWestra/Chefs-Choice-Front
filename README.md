# Chefs-Choice-Front
Welcome to chef's choice!

This is the app for you.. yes You!
Even though you might not have realized it.

Ever encountered that piece of ham that just,
passed the expiry date.. yea me too.
Wouldn't it be great if we had a simple App, 
(subtle hint, this is that app ;) ) to look 
for a recipe based on the ingredients we enter? 
I know.. i know. how has no one thought of ths before?
i asked myself the same question. Well now someone has. 
ME! :D isnt that crazy?? 10 weeks ago i was learning how, 
to console.log("doesn't that seem like a long time ago?")
Now im here building full stack apps. And actually being able
to transfer my ideas into code:D!! i know crazy stuff.. 

enough about me. lets shed some light on the app.. 

# HomePage
A random recipe just for you.. Looks good? 
why not save it for later? simply add it to your favorites

# Discover
Enter up to 5 ingredients. and boom! 5 recipes just for you. 
showing exactly what you need to know. what can i use of the igredients
ive entered and what do i still need to get..

# Favorites
Saved ingredients. This is were the magic happens. All the cool recipes 
you find and save.. end up here.. Lets find out more! 

# Account

simply log out!
